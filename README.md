Pre-processing and analysis

The code here refers to the script used in the paper: Timing along the cardiac cycle modulates neural signals of reward-based learning

The main scrpit to pre-process the data is presented as well as the core of the Machine Learning Scripts and the Reinforcement Learning model used to fit the behavioral data
